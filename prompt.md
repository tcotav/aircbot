We started creating this irc bot to work in private channels that we participate in. Now we want to have it call out to an LLM for certain commands that come to our bot. 

We are locally serving an LLM using Ollama. The bot should be able to call out to the LLM for certain commands, such as `!ask` or `!chat`, and return the response from the LLM to the IRC channel. Please write code for the ask functionality first and use an OpenAI compatible API for the LLM calls.
